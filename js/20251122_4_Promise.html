        /**
         * Fetch url returns a response. The response has a JSON object
         * Fetch results in asynchronous execution.
         * Promise functions can be used to handle asynchronous execution using "then" when it is executed successfully
         * And "catch" when there is failed execution.
         * In JavaScript, a "Promise" is an object that represents the eventual completion 
         * (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. 
         * It acts as a placeholder for a value that might not be available immediately but will be at some point in the future. 
         * In Angular, we have observables that are built on top of promise.
